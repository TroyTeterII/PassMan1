PassMan1 is a simple offline password manager that keeps track of what password goes with different emails.
Data is encrypted upon storage.
I plan on slowly incorperating more features that are used by top 500 companies, and slowly build on top of what I have working.
Ideas are things like: database having ID numbers and sql injection protection on inputs.
use an email with multiple passwords stored. 
encrypt and decrypt for experiments sake.
password reset.
I'll add more as time goes on. the project is boring but its a good way to get back on the horse for now.
